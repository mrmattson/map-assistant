# Map Assistant

## Introduction

You have mappable data that is not in a format you can immediately use:
*   rows of poorly formatted locations in a spreadsheet,
*   a blob of text with odd or multiple formats, or
*   GeoJSON, but you need KML.

Additionally, the data may define shapes other than points, lines, and polygons:
*   Circles (or point buffers),
*   Corridors (or line buffers), or
*   Point, or other shape, defined as a bearing and a distance from another.

You are tired of hand-jamming data and worrying about transcription error.  Welcome!

This app has a simple purpose.  Reduce the amount manual entry and processing to make use location based data.
